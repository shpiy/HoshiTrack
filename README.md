HoshiTrack is a simple web application built with Python and Streamlit to help track, visualize, and analyze all the media consumed. From movies and TV shows to books and podcasts, never lose track of what is once experienced.


## üåü Features
* **API-Powered Discovery:** Search for add new movies directly from The Movie Database (TMDB), complete with posters and release information.
* **Intelligent Local Search:** Uses a custom-built **fuzzy search algorithm** (Levenshtein distance) to find items in library even with typos.
* **Modern Card UI:** A clean, modern interface displays your media collection as interactive cards with posters, ratings, and status.
* **Simple Data Storage:** The media library is stored in a human-readable `data.json` file.

## üöÄ Usage

To run HoshiTrack on our local machine, follow these steps.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:shpiy/HoshiTrack.git
cd HoshiTrack
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure API Key

Create a folder and file for your Streamlit secrets:
```bash
mkdir .streamlit
touch .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

Open the `secrets.toml` file and add your TMDB API key:
```bash
TMDB_API_KEY="paste_your_api_key_here"
```

### 4. Run the Application

Launch the Streamlit app from your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run App.py
```

The application should now be open and running in your web browser.

## ‚úÖ To-Do

- [ ] **Implement a Filter Bar**
  - Add a dedicated filter section to allow users to refine their library view
  - **Filter by Status:** Include buttons or a dropdown to filter by 'Completed', 'In Progress', or 'Plan to Watch'.
  - **Filter by Rating:** Add a slider or input to filter media by a specified rating range (e.g., 4 stars and above).
  - **Filter by Genre:** Create a multi-select box to let users filter by one or more genres.

- [ ] **Expand Media Category Support with More APIs**
  - Integrate additional APIs to allow searching for and adding different types of media beyond movies
  - **Books:** Implement a client for the **Google Books API**
  - **TV Shows:** Extend the `api_client` to use the `/search/tv` endpoint from TMDB
  - **Video Games:** Implement a client for a video game API like **RAWG.io** or **IGDB**
  - **Podcasts:** Investigate and implement a podcast API like **Listen Notes**

- [ ] **Deploy Application as a Live Website**
